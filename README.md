# CryptoExplorer-Pro
An app that displays information about cryptocurrencies, such as their value, market cap, and percent change in value, which are accessed using API calls. An search bar is also implemented, which allows users to search for a specific currency. Used ReactRouter to create dynamic URLs for the app.

There will be a pop up asking what level of permissions your key needs, just check the "Read All Price Streaming and Polling Endpoints" option. Copy the API Key for use later.
